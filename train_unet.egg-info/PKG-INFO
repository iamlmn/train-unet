Description: # Train Unet
        
        Aim is to create a low-code easy to use python library for training CNN models using Unet architecture with custom metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union) for semantic segmentation of medical images/scans.
        
        ## Applications in Medical Imaging
        - Many medical applications necessitates finding and accurately labeling things found in medical scans.
        - This is often done using advanced software to assist medical technicians and doctos. However, this task still requires human intervention and such as, can be tedious,slow, expensive and prone to human error.
        - There's huge initiative for use Computer Vision and Deep Learning to automate many of these tasks. 
        
        Analyzing medical scans such as
         - CAT scans
         - X-rays
         - Ultra sound 
         - PET
         - NMR

        <!-- ## What is image segmentation?
         The goal of segmentation is seperate different parts of image, into sensible coherent parts where we are doing a pixel wise predictions.
        
         Two types of segmentation:
         1. Instance segmentation.
         	Pixel classificcation combined with classifying object entities e.g. Seperate persons, cars. etc.
         2. Semantic segmentation.
         	> Pixel classifications based on defined classes e.g roads, persons, cars, trees etc.
         -->

        ## U-net  - Image segmentation using CNN's.
        
        U-net has become very popular end-to-end encoder-decoder network for Semantic segmentation.
        
        It has a unique Up-down archtiecture which has a contracting path and an expansive path.

        ## Intersection over union(IoU) metrics
        IoU is basically a measure of overlap.
        
        IoU = ^Size_of_union/_Size of Intersection
         - Typically IoU over 0.5 is acceptable.
         - higher the IoU better the prediction.
